<p><b>Rescued Date:</b> May 12, 2018<br>

<b>Given Name:</b> Poco<br>

<b>Age:</b>Approximately 3-4 weeks<br>

<b>Sex:</b> Female<br>

<br>

According to people in the market yesterday, the kitten was still walking (no one really noticed such animals)

Think of you as sick, without water and food and the weather is very hot. Approx 3-4 weeks. Emaciated. Severely dehydrated. Crusty eyes and has a heavy discharge on the nose.
The black cat is often thrown into the misconception of others that it brings bad luck. <br><br>

<b>Poco is up for adoption!</b> Spayed and Dewormed. </p>

<p><b>Rescued Date:</b> August 18, 2018<br>
<b>Given Name:</b>Filemon (Fil)<br>
<b>Age:</b>2 years old<br>
<b>Sex:</b> Female
<br><br>
Fil found abandoned. Emaciated and lethargic. Lots of itching up to her genitals.
Infested with fleas. The abdomen is also bloated, most probably due to internal parasites. Such diseases are curable. But other people just chose to throw the animal away.
He was too small to find shelter and food.
